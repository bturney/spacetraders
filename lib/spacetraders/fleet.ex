  The Fleet context: the ships an Agent owns and their live state.

  A ship's live state — location, fuel, cargo, cooldown, nav status — is pulled
  from the game through `SpaceTraders.API`. The server is the source of truth;
  the local `ships` table is the app's registry of owned ships (seeded with the
  starter fleet) and carries no live state. The dashboard reads the live fleet
  through this context so it stays a thin consumer with no game logic of its own.

  Pulls the agent's live fleet from the game API.

  Each ship carries its current nav (location + docked/orbiting/transit state),
  fuel, cargo and cooldown — the data the fleet cards render.

  Returns `{:ok, [%SpaceTraders.API.Model.Ship{}]}` or an API error. An agent
  without a stored AgentToken returns `{:error, :agent_token_missing}`.
